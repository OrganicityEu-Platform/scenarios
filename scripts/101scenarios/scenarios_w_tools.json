Different means of transportation are generally available to him and include walking, biking, moped/scooter (own, shared, electric/petrol), car (own, pooling, ride sharing, taxi), public transportation (bus, metro, train, ferry/boat). Transportation can be optimized to Tonys preferred travel time, convenience (comfort, seating, crowdedness, safety, environmental quality), total cost, environmental impacts, scenic route, and personal health. Factors that impact this optimization include conditions of the different transportation modes (road, weather, maintenance works, traffic intensity, people density, parking availability, charging pole availability, pollution, air quality, irregularities in traffic schedules, road tolls, seating availability, accidents, availability of city bikes, ...). Tony will be presented with his ideal route and will be able to select each leg of the journey based on concurrent and projected aggregated conditions. Recalculation of his chosen route(s) can happen if conditions or preferences change, and will adapt to any detour of own choice.","sectors":["Transport"],"actors":["Public"," citizen"],"tools":["Transport"," mobile"]},{"title":"Public parking space availability prediction ","narrative":"Frank is having a hard time finding a public parking space. \rThe city is increasingly reducing the amount of parking spaces per unit (e.g. apartments), and the difficulty \rof finding a parking space means Frank has to circulate his car looking for available parking spots.

The car park is facilitated with an automated ticketing system, which displays the number of vehicles parked and the number of vacancies available. These numbers are automatically updated on entrance or exit of any vehicle. Even though at the main entrance it is shown that vacancies are available, every driver has to drive for a very long time to find a suitable/empty space, resulting in waste of time and money/resources. Citizens also want to park closest to their favorite sports facility. The smart car parking system is equipped with individual sensors at all car parking spaces. The users therefore have a mobile app available for the smart car parking system, which integrates real time sensor information of the car parking space, its GPS locations and combines it with the user profiles to find a suitable place while considering the user's sport interest, event starting time, tickets purchased/seat numbers etc.","sectors":["Transport"],"actors":["Public"," private"," citizen"],"tools":["Transport"," mobile"]},{"title":"Smart/green buildings","narrative":"Jason works for a medium scale organization with more than 200 employees.

David shows her the \"continuous care\" application that he is currently using for the recovery from his heart attack, and tells her that he is feeling very comfortable with it. Back in her hometown Charlotte asks her doctor about a similar application and they agree that such a system will be suitable for Charlotte, too. A special device for her home will help her to monitor her blood pressure, blood sugar, etc., and in case she falls will also transmit an alert. She feels relieved and can now spend more time with her friends doing activities she enjoys.","sectors":["Healthcare"],"actors":["Citizen"],"tools":["Healthcare"]},{"title":"Smart sun protection","narrative":"Jules is on the beach with his little daughter, Pauline, of 2 years. Pauline loves sand and sun as all small children do. However, children have very sensitive skin and despite high protection sun lotion there is always a risk of sunburn. Pauline has a small UV sensor on her cap which allows Jules's mobile phone to monitors the amount of UV radiation by getting measurement information from the sensor. The Sunburn Protection application on the phone sets an alarm when it is time to go to the shade. The safe time in the sun is calculated according to the amount of UV radiation, the age of the person, the skin type, the pigment level and previous suntan.","sectors":["Environment"],"actors":["Citizen"],"tools":["Environment"]},{"title":"Aging population - home monitoring","narrative":"Grandma had opened the bedroom windows to get fresh air, but forgot to close them.

Finally, she also puts her mobile phone in her pocket and activates the personal trainer agent (PTA) that monitors her activities and controls the sensors in her clothes, body area and shoes. The PTA can suggest improvements or training sets to enhance Alice's agility or strength. Using actuators such as vibrators or sound, the PTA can also provide feedback and helps Alice to improve her movements.","sectors":["Public"],"actors":["Citizen"],"tools":["Mobile"," wearable sensors"]},{"title":"Automated social networking","narrative":"Tom is using a new application on his phone that assists him in being as visible as possible on his social networks.

For monitoring them he uses a new \"smart herding\" system. The system enables welfare-friendly confinement of cattle with boundaries drawn entirely by global positioning system (GPS) - existing as a fence line only on a computer, without wires or fixed transmitters. The system builds on the basic principle of an electric fence, except there is no fence. Instead it includes a wireless sensor network containing microcomputers, radios, and sensors, some of which are fitted into cattle neck collars and emit a sound when the animals approach the virtual boundary. If an animal crosses the boundary it will receive a small electric shock - around one fifth of the voltage used in a conventional electric fence - and will learn to avoid the boundary. The electric stimuli and sound signal will both stop if the animal runs past the virtual fence, and will be re-applied when the animal has stopped moving to encourage it to move out of the exclusion zone. Once the boundary is set, the system is fully automated and self-sufficient. Because it includes a wireless sensor network with two-way communication to the collars, Danny can set a new fence line anytime, from the office, as well as continuously monitor where his cattle are located.","sectors":["Agriculture"],"actors":["Private"],"tools":["Mobile"]},{"title":"Digital DJ","narrative":"Managers of entertainment establishments will now be able to promptly adapt the ambiance and animation according to permanent monitoring of the audience's mood and activity.
